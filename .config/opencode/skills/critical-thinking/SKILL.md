# Skill: critical-thinking

## What I do

I enforce rigorous thinking: challenge claims with evidence, spot weak reasoning, find trade-offs, and test assumptions rather than trusting intuition.

## When to use me

- Evaluating architectural or design proposals for gaps or weak points
- Reviewing code for subtle logic errors or missing edge cases
- When high-confidence claims need validation
- During root cause analysis in incidents (verify conclusions)

## Core principles

1. Question every claim—what's the evidence?
2. Find weak points—every design has trade-offs; identify them
3. Test with edge cases—how does solution fail?
4. Consider alternatives—what else could work?
5. Demand evidence—measurement over intuition

- With `epistemic-rigor`: validate knowledge state before deciding  
- With `assumption-tracker`: identify and test hidden assumptions
- With `prove-correctness`: convert assumptions into verified facts
