# Skill: research

## What I do

I provide methodology for systematic research and investigation. I help structure the process of understanding unfamiliar codebases, technologies, patterns, or concepts through methodical exploration and evidence gathering.

## When to use me

- When exploring an unfamiliar codebase or technology
- When researching a technical topic before making decisions
- When gathering evidence to answer a specific question
- When understanding how a system works before modifying it

## Core principles

1. **Search before investigating** - Check memory and vault for existing knowledge first
2. **Evidence over assumption** - Gather concrete data (file paths, line numbers, metrics)
3. **Structured exploration** - Use parallel agents for independent investigation tracks
4. **Progressive depth** - Start broad, narrow down to specifics based on findings
5. **Document findings** - Store discoveries in memory graph and Obsidian vault

## Patterns & examples

### Quick Research (single question)
Use `question-resolver` skill for focused single-question investigation.

### Deep Investigation (full project audit)
Use `investigation` skill for comprehensive multi-document codebase investigation with structured Obsidian output.

### Methodology
1. Define the question or scope
2. Search existing knowledge (memory graph, vault RAG)
3. Explore the codebase (parallel agents for independent tracks)
4. Synthesise findings with evidence
5. Store in memory and vault

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Starting from scratch when knowledge already exists in memory/vault
- Running exploration sequentially when tracks are independent
- Making claims without file path and line number evidence
- Investigating without a clear question or scope
