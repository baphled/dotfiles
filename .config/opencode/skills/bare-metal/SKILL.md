# Skill: bare-metal

## What I do

I guide physical server provisioning, colocation management, and dedicated hardware deployment for high-performance computing, GPU workloads, and scenarios requiring full hardware control.

## When to use me

- High-performance computing and GPU-intensive workloads
- Full hardware control for optimisation and tuning
- Compliance requirements mandating physical isolation
- Cost optimisation at scale (large stable workloads)
- Latency-sensitive applications requiring bare metal performance

## Core principles

1. Automation over manual provisioning (PXE boot, Ansible)
2. Configuration management for reproducible deployments
3. Monitor everything: hardware health, temperature, disk SMART
4. Hardware redundancy (RAID, dual PSU, spare components)
5. Disaster recovery with offsite backups and runbooks

## Decision triggers

- Load with `devops` for provisioning automation
- Load with `scripter` for hardware management scripts
- Load with `automation` for deployment orchestration
- Load with `monitoring` for hardware health tracking
- For provisioning patterns, refer to Obsidian vault
