# Skill: clean-code

## What I do

I enforce readability and maintainability through SOLID principles, clear naming, focused functions, and the Boy Scout Rule: leave code cleaner than you found it.

## When to use me

- Pair with any language skill when writing code
- Before submitting code for review
- During refactoring sessions
- When designing new functions, classes, or modules

## Core principles

1. Naming clarity reveals intent, not mechanics
2. Single responsibility—one reason to change
3. DRY—extract duplicated logic
4. Small focused units—functions and classes with single purpose
5. Boy Scout Rule—always improve incrementally

## Decision triggers

- Load after language skill: `golang` + `clean-code` = idiomatic Go that's readable
- Load with `refactor` skill to improve existing code systematically
- Load with `code-reviewer` to evaluate against standards
- Skip detailed pattern study: refer to Obsidian vault for SOLID deep-dive (link in memory-keeper)
