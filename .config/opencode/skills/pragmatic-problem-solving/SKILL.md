# Skill: pragmatic-problem-solving
## What I do

I focus on practical solutions that ship working code, balancing ideal designs with achievable timelines. This skill teaches how to validate approaches early, cut scope wisely, and deliver value incrementally.
## When to use me

- Facing impossible deadlines or constraints
- Choosing between perfect code and working features
- Deciding what to cut from a feature
- Evaluating whether to build or buy
- Iterating based on real user feedback
## Core principles

1. Working beats perfect—ship fast, iterate based on feedback
2. Validate assumptions early—build prototypes, test with users before committing
3. Cut ruthlessly—know your constraints, say no to scope creep
4. Iterate in cycles—deliver value incrementally, not all at once
5. Measure success practically—does it solve the user problem?
## Patterns & examples

### MVP Definition
Identify minimum features to solve the core problem. Defer nice-to-haves. Ship first iteration in days, not months.

### Scope Cutting
When behind, cut features not affecting core value. Move polish to 'v1.1'. Focus on 'does it work?' not 'is it perfect?'
## Anti-patterns to avoid

Building perfect code for features users never requested
Over-engineering before validating the approach works
Refusing to cut scope even when timeline is impossible
