# Skill: pre-action

## What I do

I force deliberate thinking before significant action: clarify the goal, understand constraints, evaluate options, and choose the best approach rather than reacting immediately.

## When to use me

- Always load automatically before major coding, deployment, or irreversible changes
- When facing unclear requirements or multiple viable approaches
- Before committing to an architecture or design decision

## Core principles

1. Stop and think—pause before acting
2. Clarify intent—state goal, constraints, success criteria
3. Evaluate options—consider at least 2 approaches before deciding
4. Choose consciously—make explicit trade-off decisions
5. Verify understanding—confirm you've grasped the problem

## Decision triggers

- Always-active: load with every agent session automatically
- Load before `critical-thinking` for rigorous analysis of complex decisions
- Load with `memory-keeper` to capture decision reasoning
- For detailed decision frameworks, refer to Obsidian vault (memory-keeper will point there)
