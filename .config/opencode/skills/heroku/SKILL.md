# Skill: heroku

## What I do

I guide Heroku Platform-as-a-Service deployment for rapid prototyping and small-to-mid sized applications using managed infrastructure, add-ons, and git-based workflows.

## When to use me

- Rapid prototyping and MVP development
- Small-to-mid sized web applications
- Teams preferring PaaS simplicity over infrastructure management
- Applications needing managed Postgres, Redis, or other add-ons
- Quick deployment from git repositories

## Core principles

1. Follow 12-factor app methodology strictly
2. Use add-ons for databases, caching, monitoring
3. Git-based deployment with automatic builds
4. Define process types in Procfile (web, worker, scheduler)
5. Manage configuration through environment variables

## Decision triggers

- Load with `devops` for deployment automation
- Load with `configuration-management` for config vars and buildpacks
- Load with `release-management` for Heroku pipelines and review apps
- Load with `monitoring` for Heroku metrics and logging
- For 12-factor principles, refer to Obsidian vault
