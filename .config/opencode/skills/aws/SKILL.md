# Skill: aws

## What I do

I guide AWS cloud infrastructure deployment using managed services like EC2, ECS, S3, Lambda, RDS, and CloudFront to build scalable, resilient cloud-native applications.

## When to use me

- Cloud-native applications requiring global scale
- Serverless architectures with Lambda and API Gateway
- Managed databases (RDS, DynamoDB) for production workloads
- Object storage and CDN with S3 and CloudFront
- Container orchestration with ECS/EKS

## Core principles

1. Use managed services over self-managed infrastructure
2. Design for failure with Multi-AZ and auto-scaling
3. IAM least privilege for all service access
4. Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, Terraform)
5. Monitor everything with CloudWatch and X-Ray

## Decision triggers

- Load with `devops` for CI/CD and deployment pipelines
- Load with `configuration-management` for infrastructure as code
- Load with `scripter` for AWS CLI automation
- Load with `monitoring` for CloudWatch setup
