# Skill: memory-keeper

## What I do

I systematically capture problem-solution pairs, patterns discovered, and common mistakes into a knowledge graph. This creates searchable institutional memory that prevents repeating debugging work.

## When to use me

- After solving a difficult bug or problem (capture solution)
- When discovering a new pattern or technique (capture insight)
- After investigating a complex issue (capture findings)
- When learning something that took significant time (prevent repeat learning)

## Core principles

1. Capture context and why, not just the what
2. Make findings searchable with clear terminology
3. Verify accuracy before storing (no false memories)
4. Link related discoveries to see patterns emerge
5. Search memory before investigating (read before write)

## Decision triggers

- Always-active: load with every session to capture learnings
- Load with `pre-action` to decide what's worth capturing
- Load with `epistemic-rigor` to verify accuracy before storing
- For knowledge graph structure and schema, refer to Obsidian vault
