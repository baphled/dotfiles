# Skill: virtual

## What I do

I guide virtualisation and VPS hosting deployment using providers like DigitalOcean, Linode, Hetzner, and Vultr for cost-effective self-managed infrastructure.

## When to use me

- Cost-effective hosting for smaller workloads
- Development and staging environments
- Self-managed infrastructure with full root access
- Learning environment for DevOps practices
- Applications not requiring managed services

## Core principles

1. Snapshot and backup regularly (automated schedules)
2. Use cloud-init for automated instance provisioning
3. Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, bandwidth)
4. Security hardening (firewall, fail2ban, SSH keys only)
5. Automated provisioning with Terraform or Ansible

## Decision triggers

- Load with `devops` for deployment automation
- Load with `automation` for provisioning scripts
- Load with `scripter` for system administration tasks
- Load with `configuration-management` for reproducible setups
